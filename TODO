- connect auth0 and allow users to backup their key and optionally all of their data (if auth0 allows this) to it
- should make a separate file of functions that work with and define mon/item/etc schemas. these are plain objects. they should not be nested, ideally.
- configurable sprites and other user prefs, start writing universal UI, connect auth0...
- genMon should take a filter function to implement the gacha tokens
- work on items
- css grid
- consider allowing nested data in gun and refactor the `.on()` listener in `subscribe` to re-get the node and call `.load()` (since calling it on the callback `data` arg itself apparently doesn't work). unsure what issues (proably performance) this might cause
- genMon needs a couple companion functions- editMon is probably unneeded (just use normal putMon logic) but you'll definitely need an evolveMon function that handles edge cases
- current item inventory: evolution items, form change items, gacha tokens
- sprite preferences
